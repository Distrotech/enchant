{"name":"Enchant","tagline":"","body":"libenchant -- Generic spell checking library\r\nDom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>\r\n\r\n   libenchant is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL included in the\r\nfile COPYING.LIB.\r\n\r\n   The project aims to provide an efficient extensible abstraction for\r\ndealing with different spell checking libraries.\r\n\r\n   Enchant is meant to provide a generic interface into various existing\r\nspell checking libaries. These include, but are not limited to:\r\n\t* Aspell/Pspell\r\n\t* Ispell\r\n\t* Hspell\r\n\t* Uspell\r\n\r\n   Enchant is also meant to be used in a cross-platform (XP) environment. Part\r\nof this means that Enchant wants to limit its number of external dependencies\r\nto 0, or as close is as humanly possible. Also, any enchant consumer (i.e. a\r\nWord Processor) should not need to know about what backend providers Enchant\r\nknows about. In fact, Enchant shouldn't even need to know this information\r\nitself. To accomplish this, all of Enchant's providers are DLLs.\r\n\r\n   Enchant is also meant to be used in a multi-user environment, such as Unix.\r\nIt is preferable to have both a $USER and a $GLOBAL location for both \r\nprovider DLLs and for dictionaries themselves, when possible. Enchant's DLL\r\nlocation algorithm takes this into account, and gives preference to the $USER\r\nDLLs, when found.\r\n\r\nTo report libenchant bugs, please visit bugzilla.abisource.com.\r\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License\r\n    as published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
